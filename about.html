            <h2>Performance = THUNDER = Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Before we were THUNDER, we were hardware junkies, computer geeks, hardcore gamers, and everything in between.
                Building the ultimate system for unbeatable gaming and computing performance is not just a business to us, it is our innermost passion, our purpose - we live and breathe it.
                It is embedded within our DNA. That is how we came to understand extreme users like yourself so well. Because we are extreme users and gamers ourselves too.
                We understand the challenge of finding the right machine to suit your specific gaming needs.
                Because we've been there. We understand a system has to offer more than just powerful specs.
                The design, construction and weight, finishing, future upgrade options, and even down to the last keyboard key, they all have to be in unison.
                It had to be perfect. Because that's what we'd want too as users ourselves. We understand.
                This unique connection we share with our customers has allowed THUNDER to grow rapidly from
                our humble beginning as a gaming laptop startup in 2011 to an established customized gaming and high-performance laptop brand it is today.

            <h2>Perfectionists in Extreme Computing</h2>
            <p>
                Perfection, and nothing less. We never compromise when we build a system, because we build every system as if we were going to use it ourselves.
                And in fact we do. Each and every one of our systems are designed and engineered by experts with years of experience and are rigorously tested for reliability
                and performance before they are delivered to our customers.
                Our 'no-compromise' approach to performance computing has not gone unnoticed.
                Our products has not only earned the respect and trust of a growing community of gamers, but also an emerging group of high-end users such as designers,
                3D modellers, video editors, multimedia content creators and creative professionals alike.
                We also understand that no two users are the same. That is why we serve every single customer as if they are the only customer.
                We engage, listen and explore every option available with each customer to help them find that ONE perfect system.
                This personalized approach is perfectly encapsulated in our tagline Engineered for One, where every system is meticulously crafted
                by one experienced engineer to best suit one specific user.
